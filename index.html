      <div class="col-md-5" id="description">
        A multidisciplinary <span class="maroon"> coder</span>, seamstress, and published academic author,
        Gaby is happiest when throwing herself into a problem she doesn't quite
        know how to solve. With work experience ranging from LGBT advocacy at
        the <span class="maroon">United Nations</span> in New York to volunteering with special needs adults
        at a log yard in Vanderhoof, BC, she is always eager to take on a new
        challenge and learn something new!
        <br /><br />
        After starting at BCIT last year, she is now eligible for a <span class="maroon">
        co-op</span> internship from May to December 2018. She's most interested in
        positions that solve <span class="maroon">real-world
        problems</span>, whether that be the speed and reliability of a program, or working on
        multi-layered, complex problems. She's already
        comfortable with <span class="maroon">Java, HTML, CSS and PHP,</span>
        and is looking forward to improving her C and SQL this term.
